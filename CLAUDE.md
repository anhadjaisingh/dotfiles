# Claude Instructions for dotfiles

## Repository Purpose
This is the user's personal dotfiles repository containing configuration files for various tools and applications. These dotfiles are designed to be symlinked to their appropriate locations on the machine (e.g., `.zshrc` gets symlinked to `$HOME/.zshrc`, `.gitconfig` to `$HOME/.gitconfig`, etc.).

## Preferred Languages
The user primarily works with these languages (use for tooling setup, syntax highlighting, formatters, etc.):
- Python
- Bash/Shell
- Lua

## Key conventions:
- Use consistent indentation and formatting
- Test configurations before committing
- Follow existing naming patterns
- Run linting/formatting tools when available
